You do not need to try to answer the question but simply plan out the steps.\\n\\nThe knowledge graph contains node types: Gene, DrugClass, Drug, Disease, Pathway, BiologicalProcess, MolecularFunction, CellularComponent, Symptom, BodyPart.         \\nGene nodes have gene type as a property.\\nThe knowledge graph contains relationships: \"CHEMICAL BINDS GENE\",\"CHEMICAL INCREASES EXPRESSION\", \"CHEMICAL DECREASES EXPRESSION\", \"DRUG IN CLASS\", \"DRUG TREATS DISEASE\", \"DRUG CAUSES EFFECT\", \"GENE PARTICIPATES IN BIOLOGICAL PROCESS\", \"GENE IN PATHWAY\", \"GENE INTERACTS WITH GENE\", \"GENE HAS MOLECULAR FUNCTION\", \"GENE ASSOCIATED WITH CELLULAR COMPONENT\", \"GENE ASSOCIATES WITH DISEASE\", \"BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE\", \"BODYPART UNDEREXPRESSES GENE\", \"SYMPTOM MANIFESTATION OF DISEASE\", \"DISEASE LOCALIZES TO ANATOMY\", \"DISEASE ASSOCIATES WITH DISEASE\".\\n\\nOnly show the steps you will take and a small description for each step. If you can determine the knowledge graph relationship that can provide insight in the step, provide the relationship in it and if possible the specific node name, not the node type. If a question require a specific relationship between two specific nodes, provide the specific nodes in the relationship.\\n\\nHere is your question:\\nOnly answer if this is true or false: Benzatropine can treat Alzheimer\\'s Disease\\n\\nLet\\'s think step by step, and be very succinct, clear, and efficient in the number of steps by avoiding redundant knowledge extractions.'}\n",

Each step will be within <Step> tags and will have an incremental <StepID> value within it. The full description of the step will be put in the <Instruction> tags within the <Step>. Following the <Instruction>, there should only be one type of instruction within a <Step>: <KnowledgeRequest> or <Function>\\n\\n<KnowledgeRequest>:\\n If a request to the knowledge graph needs to be made within a step, you must include the knowledge requests as simple single node to Relationship to node format. Each <KnowledgeRequest> should have an identifier in <KnowledgeID> tags such as Knowledge_1 and Knowledge_2.  Any knowledge request should have the format of <Knowledge> tag where it labeled with: Node Name-Relationship-Node Name. There must be at least one specific node that is requested such as a specific gene or disease. If there are any specific nodes and not a node type, put a ! before and after the word. For instance, Alzheimer\\'s is a specific Disease node, so it should be labeled \"!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\". Another example are of gene symbols, which are specific genes, so they should be labeled \"!APOE!\". \\nEach <KnowledgeRequest> should contain a specific node and should not be between two node types. For instance, \"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\" is correct, but \"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-Disease\" is incorrect.        \\nIf you detect two specific keywords in the query, you can use both of them in a single <Request> tag. For instance, \"!APOE!-GENE ASSOCIATES WITH DISEASE-!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\" is correct, instead of having two separate <Request> tags. Most requests should have one specific keyword. If a step requests for only a single node, omit that step altogether. You must be sure that the relationship is from the above list as well as the node types.\\n\\nHere is an example <KnowledgeRequest> requesting for all body parts connected to the gene STYXL2: \\n<KnowledgeRequest>\\n    <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n    <Node>BODYPART-GENE EXPRESSES-!STYXL2!</Node>\\n</KnowledgeRequest>\\n\\n<Function>:\\nYou will have functionality of running array based functions that the machine will execute:\\n  UNION(x,y): This function returns a distinct union of elements that are in set x and set y\\n  INTERSECT(x,y): This function returns all elements that are found in both set x and set y\\n  DIFFERENCE(x, y): This function returns the elements that are in set x but not in set y. It\\'s useful for finding the elements unique to one set compared to another. \\nAny reference to arrays determined by previous steps should be by either the <StepID> identifier or <KnowledgeID> identifier. There should be no Knowledge Requests within a Function, only the identifiers. If an request is needed, the Knolwedge Request should be done within the same step.\\n\\nIf a function needs to be run such as UNION, INTERSECT, or DIFFERENCE using the knowledge, that should be within <Function> tags with nothing else other than the function and its variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of a <Function> requesting the Intersect of two arrays from two knowledge requests:\\n<Function>\\n    INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n</Function>\\n\\nHere is an example XML:\\n<Instructions>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>1</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene METTL5\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n                <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_1</KnowledgeID>\\n                <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!METTL5!</Node>\\n            </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>2</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene STYXL2\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n            <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n            <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!STYXL2!</Node>\\n        </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>3</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            List the intersect of body parts\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <Function>\\n            INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n        </Function>\\n    </Step>\\n</Instructions>\\n\\nOutside of the <Instructions> tag, add an edge list in <EdgeList>, where information from one step to another will be listed.

Each step will be within <Step> tags and will have an incremental <StepID> value within it. The full description of the step will be put in the <Instruction> tags within the <Step>. Following the <Instruction>, there should only be one type of instruction within a <Step>: <KnowledgeRequest> or <Function>\\n\\n<KnowledgeRequest>:\\n If a request to the knowledge graph needs to be made within a step, you must include the knowledge requests as simple single node to Relationship to node format. Each <KnowledgeRequest> should have an identifier in <KnowledgeID> tags such as Knowledge_1 and Knowledge_2.  Any knowledge request should have the format of <Knowledge> tag where it labeled with: Node Name-Relationship-Node Name. There must be at least one specific node that is requested such as a specific gene or disease. If there are any specific nodes and not a node type, put a ! before and after the word. For instance, Alzheimer's is a specific Disease node, so it should be labeled \\\"!Alzheimer's Disease!\\\". Another example are of gene symbols, which are specific genes, so they should be labeled \\\"!APOE!\\\". \\nEach <KnowledgeRequest> should contain a specific node and should not be between two node types. For instance, \\\"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-!Alzheimer's Disease!\\\" is correct, but \\\"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-Disease\\\" is incorrect.        \\nIf you detect two specific keywords in the query, you can use both of them in a single <Request> tag. For instance, \\\"!APOE!-GENE ASSOCIATES WITH DISEASE-!Alzheimer's Disease!\\\" is correct, instead of having two separate <Request> tags. Most requests should have one specific keyword. If a step requests for only a single node, omit that step altogether. You must be sure that the relationship is from the above list as well as the node types.\\n\\nHere is an example <KnowledgeRequest> requesting for all body parts connected to the gene STYXL2: \\n<KnowledgeRequest>\\n    <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n    <Node>BODYPART-GENE EXPRESSES-!STYXL2!</Node>\\n</KnowledgeRequest>\\n\\n<Function>:\\nYou will have functionality of running array based functions that the machine will execute:\\n  UNION(x,y): This function returns a distinct union of elements that are in set x and set y\\n  INTERSECT(x,y): This function returns all elements that are found in both set x and set y\\n  DIFFERENCE(x, y): This function returns the elements that are in set x but not in set y. It's useful for finding the elements unique to one set compared to another. \\nAny reference to arrays determined by previous steps should be by either the <StepID> identifier or <KnowledgeID> identifier. There should be no Knowledge Requests within a Function, only the identifiers. If an request is needed, the Knolwedge Request should be done within the same step.\\n\\nIf a function needs to be run such as UNION, INTERSECT, or DIFFERENCE using the knowledge, that should be within <Function> tags with nothing else other than the function and its variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of a <Function> requesting the Intersect of two arrays from two knowledge requests:\\n<Function>\\n    INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n</Function>\\n\\nHere is an example XML:\\n<Instructions>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>1</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene METTL5\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n                <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_1</KnowledgeID>\\n                <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!METTL5!</Node>\\n            </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>2</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene STYXL2\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n            <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n            <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!STYXL2!</Node>\\n        </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>3</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            List the intersect of body parts\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <Function>\\n            INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n        </Function>\\n    </Step>\\n</Instructions>\\n\\nOutside of the <Instructions> tag, add an edge list in <EdgeList>, where information from one step to another will be listed. Each edge will be within <Edge> tags, and the edge would be in the format StepID1-StepID2 which describes that StepID1 directs to StepID2.\\nDo not include any other tags other than the ones mentioned above.\\n\\nHere are the instructions you must convert:\\n1. Identify the Disease node for \\\"Alzheimer's Disease\\\".\\n   - No relationship information is required for this step.\\n\\n2. Find the Drug nodes that are connected to the Disease node from step 1 via the \\\"DRUG TREATS DISEASE\\\" relationship.\\n   - Relationship: \\\"DRUG TREATS DISEASE\\\"\\n   - Specific nodes: Disease node for \\\"Alzheimer's Disease\\\"\\n\\n3. Provide the names or identifiers of the Drug nodes found in step 2.\\n   - No further relationships or node information is required for this step, as the drug names or identifiers have already been obtained.\"\n",

Each step will be within <Step> tags and will have an incremental <StepID> value within it. The full description of the step will be put in the <Instruction> tags within the <Step>. There should only be one type of instruction within a <Step>: <KnowledgeRequest>, <For>, or <Function>\\n\\n<KnowledgeRequest>:\\n If a request to the knowledge graph needs to be made within a step, you must include the knowledge requests as simple single node to Relationship to node format. Each <KnowledgeRequest> should have an identifier in <KnowledgeID> tags such as Knowledge_1 and Knowledge_2.  Any knowledge request should have the format of <Knowledge> tag where it labeled with: Node Name-Relationship-Node Name. If there are any specific nodes and not a node type, put a ! before and after the word. For instance, Alzheimer\\'s is a specific Disease node, so it should be labeled \"!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\". Another example are of gene symbols, which are specific genes, so they should be labeled \"!APOE!\". \\nEach <KnowledgeRequest> should contain a specific node and should not be between two node types. For instance, \"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\" is correct, but \"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-Disease\" is incorrect.        \\nIf you detect two specific keywords in the query, you can use both of them in a single <Request> tag. For instance, \"!APOE!-GENE ASSOCIATES WITH DISEASE-!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\" is correct, instead of having two separate <Request> tags. Most requests should have one specific keyword.\\n\\nHere is an example <KnowledgeRequest> requesting for all genes associated with a specific cellular component \"postsynapse\": \\n<KnowledgeRequest>\\n    <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n    <Node>Gene-GENE ASSOCIATED WITH CELLULAR COMPONENT-!postsynapse!</Node>\\n</KnowledgeRequest>\\n\\n<Function>:\\nYou will have functionality of running array based functions that the machine will execute:\\n  UNION(x,y): This function returns a distinct union of elements that are in set x and set y\\n  INTERSECT(x,y): This function returns all elements that are found in both set x and set y\\n  DIFFERENCE(x, y): This function returns the elements that are in set x but not in set y. It\\'s useful for finding the elements unique to one set compared to another. \\nAny reference to arrays determined by previous steps should be by either the <StepID> identifier or <KnowledgeID> identifier.\\n\\nIf a function needs to be run such as UNION, INTERSECT, or DIFFERENCE using the knowledge, that should be within <Function> tags with nothing else other than the function and its variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of a <Function> requesting the Intersect of two arrays from two knowledge requests:\\n<Function>\\n    INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n</Function>\\n\\n<For>:\\nA For loop maybe necessary for certain steps. The For loop will be determined by entering a <For> tag within the <Step>. The <For> tag must include a <ForVariable> which is a reference to a variable such as Knowledge_1 or StepID_1 or a distinct array (ie. an array of genes). The <For> tag must also include a <ForFunction>, which will include a <KnowledgeRequest> or a <Function> using the above format that will be used to execute for each element in the <ForVariable>. The element is labeled as \"ForElement\".\\n\\nHere is an example of a <For> loop that gets the results from Step 1 and executes a knowledge request for each element in it, specifically if the gene list from Step 1 binds to a drug/chemical: \\n<For>\\n    <ForVariable>StepID_1</ForVariable>\\n    <ForFunction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest><Node>DRUG-CHEMICAL BINDS GENE-ForElement</Node></KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </ForFunction>\\n</For>\\n\\nOutside of the <Instructions> tag, add an edge list in <EdgeList>, where information from one step to another will be listed. Each edge will be within <Edge> tags, and the edge would be in the format StepID1-StepID2 which describes that StepID1 directs to StepID2.\\n\\nHere are the instructions you must convert:\\n1. Identify the genes METTL5 and STYXL2 in the knowledge graph.\\n   - Extract the nodes with the gene type and the specific gene names METTL5 and STYXL2.\\n\\n2. Determine the body parts/anatomy that over-express METTL5.\\n   - Look for the relationship \"BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE\" with METTL5 as the gene node.\\n\\n3. Determine the body parts/anatomy that over-express STYXL2.\\n   - Look for the relationship \"BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE\" with STYXL2 as the gene node.\\n\\n4. Find the common body parts/anatomy from steps 2 and 3.\\n   - Identify the body parts/anatomy that are present in both the results from steps 2 and 3.\\n\\n5. List the common body parts/anatomy as the final result.\\n   - Present the identified body parts/anatomy as the answer to the query.'''\n",
