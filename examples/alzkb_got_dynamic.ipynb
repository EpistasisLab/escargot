Each step will be within <Step> tags and will have an incremental <StepID> value within it. The full description of the step will be put in the <Instruction> tags within the <Step>. Following the <Instruction>, there should only be one type of instruction within a <Step>: <KnowledgeRequest> or <Function>\\n\\n<KnowledgeRequest>:\\n If a request to the knowledge graph needs to be made within a step, you must include the knowledge requests as simple single node to Relationship to node format. Each <KnowledgeRequest> should have an identifier in <KnowledgeID> tags such as Knowledge_1 and Knowledge_2.  Any knowledge request should have the format of <Knowledge> tag where it labeled with: Node Name-Relationship-Node Name. There must be at least one specific node that is requested such as a specific gene or disease. If there are any specific nodes and not a node type, put a ! before and after the word. For instance, Alzheimer\\'s is a specific Disease node, so it should be labeled \"!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\". Another example are of gene symbols, which are specific genes, so they should be labeled \"!APOE!\". \\nEach <KnowledgeRequest> should contain a specific node and should not be between two node types. For instance, \"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\" is correct, but \"Drug-DRUG TREATS DISEASE-Disease\" is incorrect.        \\nIf you detect two specific keywords in the query, you can use both of them in a single <Request> tag.

If a step requests for only a single node, omit that step altogether.

It\\'s useful for finding the elements unique to one set compared to another. \\nAny reference to arrays determined by previous steps should be by either the <StepID> identifier or <KnowledgeID> identifier. There should be no Knowledge Requests within a Function, only the identifiers. If an request is needed, the Knolwedge Request should be done within the same step.\\n\\nIf a function needs to be run such as UNION, INTERSECT, or DIFFERENCE using the knowledge, that should be within <Function> tags with nothing else other than the function and its variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of a <Function> requesting the Intersect of two arrays from two knowledge requests:\\n<Function>\\n    INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n</Function>\\n\\nHere is an example XML:\\n<Instructions>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>1</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene METTL5\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n                <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_1</KnowledgeID>\\n                <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!METTL5!</Node>\\n            </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>2</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene STYXL2\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n            <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n            <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!STYXL2!</Node>\\n        </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>3</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            List the intersect of body parts\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <Function>\\n            INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n        </Function>\\n    </Step>\\n</Instructions>\\n\\nOutside of the <Instructions> tag, add an edge list in <EdgeList>, where information from one step to another will be listed.

For instance, \"!APOE!-GENE ASSOCIATES WITH DISEASE-!Alzheimer\\'s Disease!\" is correct, instead of having two separate <Request> tags. Most requests should have one specific keyword. If a step requests for only a single node, omit that step altogether. You must be sure that the relationship is from the above list as well as the node types.\\n\\nHere is an example <KnowledgeRequest> requesting for all body parts connected to the gene STYXL2: \\n<KnowledgeRequest>\\n    <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n    <Node>BODYPART-GENE EXPRESSES-!STYXL2!</Node>\\n</KnowledgeRequest>\\n\\n<Function>:\\nYou will have functionality of running array based functions that the machine will execute:\\n  UNION(x,y): This function returns a distinct union of elements that are in set x and set y\\n  INTERSECT(x,y): This function returns all elements that are found in both set x and set y\\n  DIFFERENCE(x, y): This function returns the elements that are in set x but not in set y. It\\'s useful for finding the elements unique to one set compared to another. \\nAny reference to arrays determined by previous steps should be by either the <StepID> identifier or <KnowledgeID> identifier. There should be no Knowledge Requests within a Function, only the identifiers. If an request is needed, the Knolwedge Request should be done within the same step.\\n\\nIf a function needs to be run such as UNION, INTERSECT, or DIFFERENCE using the knowledge, that should be within <Function> tags with nothing else other than the function and its variables.\\n\\nHere is an example of a <Function> requesting the Intersect of two arrays from two knowledge requests:\\n<Function>\\n    INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n</Function>\\n\\nHere is an example XML:\\n<Instructions>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>1</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene METTL5\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n                <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_1</KnowledgeID>\\n                <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!METTL5!</Node>\\n            </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>2</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            Find Body Parts Over-Expressing Gene STYXL2\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <KnowledgeRequest>\\n            <KnowledgeID>Knowledge_2</KnowledgeID>\\n            <Node>BODYPART-BODYPART OVER EXPRESSES GENE-!STYXL2!</Node>\\n        </KnowledgeRequest>\\n    </Step>\\n    <Step>\\n        <StepID>3</StepID>\\n        <Instruction>\\n            List the intersect of body parts\\n        </Instruction>\\n        <Function>\\n            INTERSECT(Knowledge_1, Knowledge_2)\\n        </Function>\\n    </Step>\\n</Instructions>\\n\\nOutside of the <Instructions> tag, add an edge list in <EdgeList>, where information from one step to another will be listed. Each edge will be within <Edge> tags, and the edge would be in the format StepID1-StepID2 which describes that StepID1 directs to StepID2.\\nDo not include any other tags other than the ones mentioned above.\\n\\nHere are the instructions you must convert:\\n1. Identify the nodes involved in the question: Benzatropine (Drug), Alzheimer\\'s Disease (Disease)\\n2. Determine the relationship between the drug and disease nodes: \"DRUG TREATS DISEASE\"\\n3.
