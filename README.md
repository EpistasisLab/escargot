# ESCARGOT
LLMs like GPT-4, despite their advancements, often produce hallucinations and struggle with integrating
external knowledge effectively. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) attempts to address this by incorporating
external information, it faces significant challenges such as context length limitations and imprecise vector similarity
search. ESCARGOT aims to overcome these issues by combining LLMs with a dynamic Graph of Thoughts and knowledge
graphs, improving output reliability and reducing hallucinations.
ESCARGOT significantly outperforms industry-standard RAG methods, particularly in open-ended questions
that demand high precision. ESCARGOT also offers greater transparency in its reasoning process, allowing for the vetting
of both code and knowledge requests, in contrast to the black-box nature of LLM-only or RAG-based approaches.
