Some of the known genes that interact with PBRM1 include:1. SETD2: This gene encodes a histone methyltransferase and is involved in the regulation of histone methylation. It has been shown to physically interact with PBRM1 and the two proteins cooperate in regulating gene expression.2. ARID1A: This gene encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and is involved in gene regulation and DNA repair. ARID1A has been found to directly interact with PBRM1 and the two proteins work together in regulating gene expression.3. SMARCA4: This gene also encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. It interacts with PBRM1 and together they play a critical role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription.4. BAP1: This gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme and is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure. BAP1 interacts with PBRM1 and the two proteins have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and tumor suppression.These are just a few examples of genes that interact with PBRM1. There may be additional genes that interact with PBRM1, as our understanding of gene regulatory networks continues to improve.\n",
