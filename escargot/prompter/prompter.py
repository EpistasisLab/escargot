The knowledge base is built from a knowledge graph, but not the knowledge graph itself. You will break down the question into steps. If knowledge needs to be pulled from the knowledge base, you will provide what specific relationships or node information is necessary. You do not need to try to answer the question but simply plan out the steps.

The knowledge graph contains the following generic node types: {node_types}.
The knowledge graph contains the following relationships: {relationship_types}.

Only show the steps you will take and a small description for each step. If you can determine the knowledge graph relationship that can provide insight in the step, provide the relationship in it and the specific node name, not a generic node type. If a question require a specific relationship between two specific nodes, provide the specific nodes in the relationship.
No step should ask for a generic node type, such as "List all drugs" or "Find all diseases".
No step should ask for a generic relationship, such as "Determine the relationship between genes and body parts that represents over-expression", such as "GENE OVEREXPRESSES BODYPART".
Each step MUST be clear on what the knowledge request output should be. If the output is a list of genes, then the step should be clear on what genes should be returned.

Examples:
Question: List the genes which bind to the drug Cyclothiazide
Step 1: Find the genes that bind to the drug Cyclothiazide. (CHEMICALBINDSGENE)
Relationship: CHEMICALBINDSGENE
Node: Cyclothiazide
Step 2: List the genes that were found.

Question: List the genes which are commonly under-expressed in spinal cord and thyroid gland
Step 1: Identify Genes Under-Expressed in Spinal Cord. Return the genes in a list.
Relationship: BODYPARTUNDEREXPRESSESGENE
Node: Spinal Cord
Step 2: Identify Genes Under-Expressed in Thyroid Gland. Return the genes in a list.
Relationship: BODYPARTUNDEREXPRESSESGENE
Node: Thyroid Gland
Step 3: Find Common Genes
Action: Compare the lists of genes from steps 1 and 2 to identify common genes under-expressed in both the spinal cord and thyroid gland.

Question: True or False Question: Posaconazole binds to the gene CYP3A4
Step 1: Find the drugs that bind to the gene CYP3A4. List the drugs.
Relationship: GENE BINDS CHEMICAL
Node: CYP3A4
Step 2: Check if Posaconazole is in the list of drugs that bind to the gene CYP3A4.

Question: Which of the following belongs to the drug class Serotonin 3 Receptor Antagonists? 1. Dolasetron 2. Trastuzumab 3. Insulin pork 4. Hyaluronidase (ovine) 5. Streptokinase
Step 1: Find all drugs that are in the class 'Serotonin 3 Receptor Antagonists'
Relationship: DRUGCLASS
Node: Serotonin 3 Receptor Antagonists
Step 2: Check if Dolastrum, Trastuzumab, Insulin pork, Hyaluronidase (ovine), or Streptokinase are in the list of drugs in step 1.

Question: Which of the following under-expresses the genes CLTA and MARK4 ? 1. bronchus 2. sciatic nerve 3. immune system 4. internal capsule of telencephalon 5. uterus
Step 1: Find the body parts or anatomy that under-expresses the genes CLTA.

Let's think step by step, and be very succinct, clear, and efficient in the number of steps by avoiding redundant knowledge extractions."""

    plan_assessment_prompt = """You are a brilliant strategic thinker with access to a biomedical knowledge graph. You will receive a query that will require the knowledge graph to answer and a few approaches that will try to resolve that query. 

If knowledge needs to be pulled from the knowledge graph, they will try to provide what specific relationships or node information is necessary.
The score should reflect on how clear and efficient each step is. It is not about how many steps are taken, but the quality of the steps. The highest score approach would be specific on what knowledge to extract, especially if it includes specific nodes. For instance, an approach with step 'Find the body parts or anatomy that over-express METTL5. (BODYPART OVEREXPRESSES GENE)' scores very high since it is specific on the node METTL5 and performs a 1 hop knowledge request.
An approach where there are steps that contain a specific node with a relationship scores higher than an approach where there any steps that contain only arbitrary node types such as when a step that is a generic node type like 'Determine the relationship between genes and body parts that represents over-expression'
Do not allow steps that simply ask for a generic node, such as "List all drugs" or "Find all diseases". These steps should be be penalized in the score.
Approaches that do not include a final step that answers the question will score lower.
If the question is a multiple choice question, the approaches that include the specific multiple choice options in at least one of the steps will score higher.
In any knowledge request, generic node types should be avoided. If a step requires a specific node, it should be used. For instance, if an approach has a step 'Find the genes that are over-expressed in the brain. (GENE OVEREXPRESSED IN BODYPART-Brain)', it will score higher than an approach that has a step 'Find all genes that are over-expressed in a body part. (GENE OVEREXPRESSED IN BODYPART)'.

The knowledge graph contains node types: {node_types}.
The knowledge graph contains relationships: {relationship_types}.

Return an XML formatted list with all the approaches in Approach tags. Each approach should be within <Approach> tags and will have an incremental <ApproachID> value within it. The score should be an integer between 1-10 within <Score> tags.
An example is as follows:
